# CoulombHiggs
A mathematica package for computing quiver invariants

This project started in joint work with Jan Manschot and Ashoke Sen on the Coulomb branch formula for computing the PoincarÃ©-Laurent polynomial of the moduli space of stable representations of quivers [1011.1258, 1103.1887, 1207.2230, 1302.5498,1309.7053]. The first version of the code was released along with [1302.5498] on arXiv. Since then it has been expanded in many directions, including the Reineke formula for quivers without relations, the Jeffrey-Kirwan residue formula, various versions of the flow tree formula, and most recently the Quiver Yangian algorithm for computing non-commutative DT invariants and various tools for dealing with brane tilings. See the documentation for more details. The various versions have been uploaded on Git for the first time in Dec 2020. This Git repository is not intended for collaborative use.

The code can be used freely, but should be acknowledged if used for published results. Please send queries or bug reports to pioline@lpthe.jussieu.fr 

History of changes:

 * Release notes for 2.0: 
 * - Removed argument y from CoulombBranchFormula, CoulombBranchFormulaFromH, 
 *   HiggsBranchFormula
 * - New recursion scheme for computing CoulombF, old one can be used by setting 
 *   $QuiverRecursion=1
 * - CoulombBranchFormula now computes the Dolbeault polynomial, as a function of the 
 *   single centered degeneracies OmS[gam,y,t]; This is done by using SwapFugacity in 
 *   the last step. The y argument is dropped by using DropFugacity.
 * - The assumption that basis vectors have OmS=1 (and multiples thereof have OmS=0) can
 *   be relaxed by setting $QuiverOmSbasis=0; 
 * - New routines MutateRight, MutateRightOmS, OmSToOmS2, etc for mutations have been introduced. Generalized mutations are 
 *   by setting $QuiverMutationMult>1
 * - CyclicQuiverOmS[Avec_,t_] computes the single-centered invariant associated to a 
 *   cyclic Abelian quiver with arrows Mat[i,i+1]=Avec[i]
 * - GrassmannianPoincare[k,n,y] gives the Poincare polynomial of the Grassmannian G(k,n)
 *
