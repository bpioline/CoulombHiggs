# CoulombHiggs
A mathematica package for computing quiver invariants

This project started in joint work with Jan Manschot and Ashoke Sen on the Coulomb branch formula for computing the Poincar√©-Laurent polynomial of the moduli space of stable representations of quivers [1011.1258, 1103.1887, 1207.2230, 1302.5498,1309.7053]. The first version of the code was released along with [1302.5498] on arXiv. Since then it has been expanded in many directions, including the Reineke formula for quivers without relations, the Jeffrey-Kirwan residue formula, various version of the flow tree formula, and most recently the Quiver Yangian algorithm for computing non-commutative DT invariants. See the documentation for more details. The various versions have been uploaded on Git in Dec 2020. This Git repository is not intended for collaborative use.
